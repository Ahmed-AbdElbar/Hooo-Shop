	<p> We all know one example of dry dog food â€“ traditional commercial kibble. Dry dog food is a type of food with a very low moisture content. It can come in the form of kibble, but also includes flake foods and biscuits or mixers.Dry kibble is the most common dog food diet because it is the most economical option.

There are other benefits to dry dog food as well, no least of which the ease of storing dry kibble using a specific dog food storage container. The crunchiness of the food cleans your pet's teeth, which aids in dental hygiene. Dry dog food also doesn't expire as quickly as other types of canine food, and it doesn't need to be refrigerated.
Dry dog food contains a low moisture content, meaning that your dog will need a fresh supply of water available at all times as eating dry kibble will require him to drink more.
Dry kibble is easier to serve to your pet as well. There is no cooking, unthawing or preparation involved. All you have to do is scoop it into your dog's dish and serve it. It doesn't get any simpler than that.

This diet is not without it's disadvantages. Since a dry kibble diet is the most popular, there are also more options with this diet than any other. Unfortunately, many of the commercial dry dog foods on the market are not healthy for your pet.
