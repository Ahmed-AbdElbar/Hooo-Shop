	<p>Moist dog food is quite the opposite of dry kibble. It has a very high moisture content, which gives it a completely different texture. Moist dog food is soggy and much easier for senior dogs or dogs with poor dental health to eat as it requires no chewing.

Moist dog food is typically cooked at a very high temperature in order to sterilize the food. It may come in cans, foil trays or pouches. The food may be in meatloaf form, chunks in jelly or chunks in gravy. You can buy refrigerated and frozen moist dog food too.

This type of dog food is more expensive, though usually has a fairly long shelf life. You need to be careful when buying moist food as well. You'll need to pay attention to the protein and water content.

The higher the water content, the less nutrients are going to be in the food. This means your dog will need to consumer more food to meet his daily nutritional requirement. Look for a food that is 100% nutritionally complete, and be sure to read the label completely before making your purchase.
