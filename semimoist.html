<p style="background-color:black;color:white">What are the pros and cons of semi-moist dog food?
Semi-moist dog food contains about 60-65% water by weight, making it more expensive per energy calorie than dry food. Unfortunately, semi-moist dog food generally contains more sugar and salt than either dry or canned dog food. The extra sugar and salt mean semi-moist food is not appropriate for every dog.

Be aware that many semi-moist foods are also loaded with artificial color, chemical preservatives, and chemical flavor enhancers. Perhaps semi-moist foods are best reserved for the occasional treat - the dog version of the hot fudge sundae!

Semi-moist dog food is very convenient because feeding involves opening the pouch and pouring it into the bowl. Work with your veterinarian to determine the calorie content of the semi-moist food and an appropriate daily portion.</p>
